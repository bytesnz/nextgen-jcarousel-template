jCarousel template for Nextgen Gallery in Wordpress

This Plugin allows you to insert a gallery that is displayed using the jCarousel jQuery plugin.

This plugin uses Fancybox included with Nextgen Gallery to view the image if it is clicked on.

A user can hover over the carousel to pause the autoscroll after the current animation is complete.
